# Past Performances
The following projects have been delivered using the Qlytics Platform:

### Project 1  -  AI/ML Driven Counter Party Risk Application
Project Summary: Developed and delivered a AL/ML driven Application to calculate Counter Party Risk of Global Banks and all U.S financial institutions. This application sources and collects financial, market and controversial news data daily on 4,500+ U.S Banks and 12 large Global Financial Institutions. This project leveraged Qlytics Source and Collect (Scraping) Starter Kit, Q-Deep-NLP advanced language processing framework, ML algorithms to calculate stock volitility and a custom built python based PD (Probability of Default) model. This solution collects more than 1 million datapoints per month and leverages a ML model to score Counter Party Risk for one of the largest stock exchanges in the world. 
Project Details: https://github.com/qlyticsllc/qplatform/blob/master/past-performance/counter-party-rick.md

### Project 2  -  Environment, Social and Goverance (ESG) Rating Application
Project Summary: Developed and delivered a AL/ML driven Application to calculate corporate commitment to Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). Leveraging Qlytics platform to source and collect (scrape) sustainability reports on 45,000 global companies, in over 50 countries. Using Qlytics Q-Deep-NLP advanced language processing framework PDF reports are automatically processed to extract target data. Over 400,000 documents in 19 languages have been collected and processed with daily updates delivered as API accessible datasets from the Qlytics platform's integrated Data Exchange. The solution leverages a Machine and Deep Learning based NLP app (Q-Deep-NLP), automated workflow management to extract key knowledge-point from unstructured text documents.
 
Project Details: https://github.com/qlyticsllc/qplatform/blob/master/past-performance/ESG.md

### Project 3  - Analyze Municipal Bond Documents with Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Project Summary: Developed and delivered a neuro-linguistic programming / natural language processing (NLP) based solution to automatically read and extract knowledge from large qualities (40,000+) Municipal Bond documents for one of the largest rating agencies in the world.
